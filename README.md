# Geotagger CLI

Geotagger is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in TypeScript for geotagging photos using a GPX file. This tool utilizes [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) under the hood and requires Node.js (>=18.14.0) and npm to be installed on your machine.

## Requirements

Before using Geotagger, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: Geotagger requires Node.js version 18.14.0 or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm**: npm is the package manager for Node.js. It is typically included with the Node.js installation. You can check if npm is installed by running `npm -v` in your terminal.

3. **ExifTool**: Geotagger relies on ExifTool for interacting with image metadata. You can download ExifTool from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org/).
